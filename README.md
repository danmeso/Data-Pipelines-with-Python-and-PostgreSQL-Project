# Data-Pipelines-with-Python-and-PostgreSQL-Project
The deliverable for this project is a data pipeline that can efficiently collect, clean, and analyze
equipment and network sensor data. The pipeline should be designed to identify potential
equipment failures and schedule maintenance proactively, minimizing downtime and improving
overall equipment performance. The data pipeline will be built using Python and PostgreSQL
and with the Postgres database hosted on Google Cloud.
